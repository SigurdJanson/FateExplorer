# Skills 

## Effects of Special Abilities & Dis-/Advantages

Examples of affects on properties by Special Abilities:

* Add an application to one skill (e.g. Counterfeiter or Disarm Traps, CR 214) or several skills (e.g. SA Craft Instruments, CR 214).
* +/-n on an energy (Increased Arcane Power I-VII)
* Resilience +/- n
* Other properties +/- n (e.g. Nimble, CR 168)

In addition to this are complex special abilities which are up to the judgement of the game master (e.g. Inner Clock). However, some applications are complex but they can be directly associated with a certain application and could be visualised accordingly to assist the user.

Additionally, there are changes to possible character actions:
* Improved Regeneration (CR166)
* A skill gets a penalty/bonus (e.g. Adv Beautiful Voice, CR164)
* A selected application of a skill gets a penalty/bonus of n (e.g. SA Skill Specialization, CR 218; Adv Contortionist, CR 164). Works also for several skills with several applications (Good Looks !-2, CR 165)
* A selected sense of the skill Perception gets a penalty/bonus of n.
* -1 reduced cost of magic spells and rituals, but never below 1 (e.g. Energy Control, MoA 92).
* A success on a skill gives +n more skill points (SP) (e.g. Favourite spell work, MoA 93).
* A success on a skill gives +n more quality levels (QL) (e.g. Fisher, CR 215). In contrast, see Hunter, CR 216, which only applies the added QL to getting food.
* Grant additional rule-based actions (Leader, CR217; Suppress Pain, CR218)
* Ambidextrous (CR163).
* 1 reroll of a confirmation roll for critical hits and botches (e.g. Adv Weapon Aptitude, CR170)
* 1 reroll of best/worst die in a skill check.
